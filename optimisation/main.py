# What influences this?
#  - how long do you toast it?
#  - how long after toasting do you eat the bread?
#  - Do you have power? And how much? 
#  - Which toaster do you use?

# Writing this function is your homework. 
# The function should return the tuple of parameters that optmizes the function.
# 
# You can implement it in multiple difficulty levels:
# easy: 
#     - implement it with only two parameters: toast_duration and wait_duration
#     - e.g., utility(2,3)
#     - Implement the function by testing all possible values for these variables.
#     - (This state space has only 10000 values, so it shouldn't take too long)
#
# medium: 
#    - same as easy, but implement hill climbing
#    - see pseudo code
# hard: 
#    - also use the parameter power
#    - e.g., utility(2,3,1.2)
#    - this introduces the following complications:
#        - multiple maxima
#        - a continuous parameter
#    - implement gradient ascent
# very hard:
#    - Same as hard, but use repeated search to find all maxima. 
#    - repeated search: 
#        - apply gradient descent from different starting points.
#    - I think there are 5 maxima. But I'm not sure :-P
# prepare to cry:
#    - find the optimum for all four parameters
#    - define your own algorithm!
